# Notetaking in 2021

Taking notes has changed a lot in the last few years. In the recent past, there have been a raft of apps and services trying to lock people into monthly or annual subscriptions. The truth is that there is no need. Far too many free tools exist, and if a premium product is wanted, many are available for one-time purchase.

Never rent your own notes. Never get locked in.

Your content should be usable for you, forever, and that isn't debatable. To do this, and still get value out of your notes, there are a few things that you can do. The direction you go will depend on how _technical_ you want to be.

So let's categorise what you might want to do and be comfortable with. A few scenarios:

>Basics - Mostly text, and accessible with little hassle
>
>Advanced - You might want more control in the presentation
>
>Documentation - This will be shared and you want everyone to read it

The good part here is the tools are all "additive". You can move between these tools over time to suit your needs.

## Basic Notetaking

When we talk about basics, that's being able to get to your notes quickly on any platform, and have some formatting irrespective of the text. The key here is to write your notes in **Markdown** and have them cloud-sync.

### _Why Markdown?_

Markdown is not a language; it's a format. It's also very simple, and it's designed to be readable by human beings in its "raw" form. For example, if you want a word **bolded**, you used to have to do something like an HTML tag such as `<em>bolded</em>` and that's clunky. Just surround a word with two asterisks, and it's `**bolded**`.

You only need a few things to get started, such as headings, bold, and italics.

```
# Heading level 1
## Heading level 2
.
.
.
###### Heading level 6

**BOLD**
_italics_
```

With just these common thoughts, it's simple to achieve a reasonably organised document, often far more put together than the average 5 lines of text to remember things.

Markdown can of course do more than this, but this is the essentials. When you see a document in PLAIN TEXT, it's readable. When you see a markdown document RENDERED, it looks just like you think it would. Importantly, Markdown isn't designed to apply any _design_ elements. You can't pick a colour in Markdown; that's the job of the application or website to interpret Markdown - and that way, they can all use it.

The other tool you need is a sync service. This is up to you; set up a cloud-based folder that gets shared with all your devices. Common choices are iCloud, Dropbox, etc. When you set it up, have a top-level folder called notes, and then in the first folders inside it, set the context for what goes in. This serves two purposes:

```
SHARED-|
       >Notes
             >Category One
             >Category Two
```

First, this allows the >Notes folder to be the same "base" folder on all your shared devices. Secondly, it becomes a basic split in context. This isn't necessary, but it tends to work well.

Once you've synced everywhere, that's it. You have a system that's as good as most paid services.

Where's the magic you say? It's in the ease of writing Markdown.

## Typora

Typora is a perfect hybrid of simple writing and power. It works natively in Markdown, but you don't see it. If you forget what you're doing, that's ok, it'll do it for you.

As an example, if you highlight and `cmd-b` or `ctrl-b` some words, it'll bold them for you. If you take a look at the SOURCE document, you'll see that Typora placed asterisks in the right place for you. You'll easily see what you want bolded, but you don't have to do it that way. At the same time, you can type two asterisks into your text, and it'll turn bold, too.

Markdown can be pretty much invisible if you do it this way, but if you take the .md file with you to your iPhone, and you use something like 1Writer, you'll be able to edit the document there as well.
