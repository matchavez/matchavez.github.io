# Saturday Compromise

---

Objective: Saturday triple-tee starts were a stress to both the pro shop staff and cafe. Times on Saturdays. Slow play.

## First fix - One tee start

- Members upset with fewer times
- Retribution to staff by members
- Staff suggest wasn't worth the abuse
- Petition
- Committee members openly critical

THEREFORE:

- Experimental data not necessarily good
- Coming to an end anyhow in 6 weeks
- Start times artificially have 10am block due to spreadsheets

## COMPROMISE

- Saturdays are CLOSED to only:
  + Members
  + Member guest (max 1 per, or pro shop)

- TWO TEE START ONLY, off 1 & 10. Limit to 8 starters per time.
- Two sessions of 72 each. Can have prizes split or combined.
- All other Saturday times are still restricted to members.
- Two sessions offer a BUNDLED fee covering all prize-games. e.g. GOTD = $10
- Creation of a SATURDAY SUBCOMMITTEE
- Address the nature of sign-up spreadsheet

### Like or not, strongly feel:
- Need a Saturday Committee
- Saturday players address costs
- We remain accessible to members, or close off membership
